# PHP-Calculator
This project is a simple calculator built using HTML, CSS, and PHP. It allows users to enter two numeric values, choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) from a dropdown menu, and calculate the result by clicking the submit button. The result is displayed dynamically below the submit button on the same page. This project demonstrates basic PHP form handling, conditional logic, and dynamic content rendering in a web application.
